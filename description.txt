Library Management System
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Library Management System in C++. 
The system is designed to manage a collection of books and users in a library, providing functionalities such as adding books, searching by book name prefix, tracking borrowed books, and user management.

Features
Book Management: 
                Users can add books to the library's collection by providing book ID, name, and quantity. 
                The system keeps track of the total number of times a book has been borrowed.

Book Search: 
            The system allows users to search for books by entering a prefix of the book name. 
            Matching books are displayed to the user.

Borrower Information: 
                    Users can inquire about the individuals who have borrowed a particular book by providing the book's name. 
                    The system provides a list of names of users who have borrowed the book.

Library Printing: 
                Users can print the library's collection of books either by ID or by name. 
                The printed list includes book details such as ID, name, total quantity, and total borrowed count.

User Management: 
                Users can be added to the system with their usernames and national IDs. 
                The system ensures that valid national IDs are used and maintains a list of borrowed books for each user.

Borrowing and Returning:
                        Users can borrow and return books. The system updates book quantities, borrowed counts, and maintains records of who borrowed which books.

Interactive Menu: 
                The system provides an interactive menu for users to easily navigate and perform various operations.

Usage
To run the Library Management System, simply compile the provided C++ code and execute the resulting executable. 
The program will present an interactive menu where users can choose from a range of operations.
